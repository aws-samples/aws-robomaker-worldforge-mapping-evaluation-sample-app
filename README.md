## Testing Mapping algorithm at scale with AWS RoboMaker Worldforge

This sample application shows an example of a mapping algorithm and how we can test such an algorithm at scale using 3D [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) worlds generated by [Worldforge](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-announces-worldforge-in-aws-robomaker/) feature. The application is written for [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) eco-system and has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 system.

It leverages the [explore_lite](http://wiki.ros.org/explore_lite), [gmapping](http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping), [navigation](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation), and [turtlebot3](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3) , [s3_file_uploader](https://github.com/aws-robotics/rosbag-uploader-ros1) rospackages.

### Pre-requisites on local machine
* Ubuntu 18.04
* [Colcon](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial/#install-colcon)
* [Colcon bundle](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-bundle)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) with the appropriate [credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
